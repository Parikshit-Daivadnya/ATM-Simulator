# ATM - Simulator-

This project is a Java-based ATM Simulator that allows users to perform common ATM operations such as balance enquiry, cash withdrawal, deposits, fast cash, transaction history viewing and changing the pin.
It simulates the user experience of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) with basic authentication and transaction features.

✨ Features:
🔑 User Login and Authentication
📝 New User Sign-Up
💰 Deposit Money
💸 Withdraw Money
⚡ Fast Cash (Quick Withdrawals)
📊 Balance Enquiry
🧾 View Transaction History
🔌 Database Connectivity using MySQL

💻 Technologies Used:
Java (Core Java, Swing for GUI)
MySQL (Database)
JDBC (Database Connectivity)


⚙️ Setup Instructions
1)Install MySQL and create a database.
2)You will need a login table, signup1, signup2, signup3 and a bank table in your database.
3)Configure the database connection in Conne.java with your MySQL username and password.
4)Compile all Java files.
5)Run the project starting from the Login.java or main menu frame.


This project was developed during self-study to strengthen skills in core Java, GUI development, and database integration.


🚀 Future Enhancements to do:

-Integrate receipt printing.

Build a modern and user friendly interface.

Remote or Cloud Database
Migrate from a local MySQL DB to a cloud-hosted MySQL (e.g., AWS RDS, Google Cloud SQL) for multi-user access and deployment.

RESTful API Development
Create REST APIs using Spring Boot for all banking operations so other systems (mobile apps or frontend UIs) can interact with the backend securely.

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Add admin and staff roles:

Admin: manage users, view logs.

Staff: view complaints or manually authorize large transactions.

Transaction Analytics Dashboard
Use Power BI, Tableau, or Spring Boot + Thymeleaf to show transaction statistics, user activity heatmaps, etc.

Security Enhancements with Spring Security
Secure APIs and UI using:

Password encryption (e.g., BCrypt)

Role-based login

JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure session handling

Automated Email Notifications
Notify users after each transaction, or send monthly account summaries.

Simulated ATM Hardware Integration
Interface with mock card readers, keypads, or receipt printers using hardware simulation libraries or JavaFX UI elements.

Multi-language Support
Add i18n (internationalization) using Spring Boot to support multiple languages like Hindi, Marathi, etc.
